Ran three scenarios – low, medium and high impact – based on assumptions of varying degrees of losses for tourist arrivals over a four-month period.Government has adopted a package of policy measures to deal with the tremendous economic impact of COVID-19 that is already starting to be felt as hotel occupancies have fallen, as cruise ship arrivals are on a 30-day hiatus, and as hotel workers are being asked to take unpaid or vacation leave. (Government Package of Policy Measures to Deal with Economic Impact of COVID-19).  $5 million government has already earmarked for healthcare response, and allocating up to an additional $11 million to cover detection, isolation, treatment and other COVID-19 mitigation activities. Government is allocating $10 million to provide for a temporary unemployment benefit, administered through the National Insurance Board, for self-employed persons working in the tourism industry. Government is making a special accommodation for those self-employed individuals in the tourism industry, given the unprecedented COVID-19 impact and will offer a sponsored unemployment assistance of $200 per week, for up to eight weeks. Individuals who are temporarily laid off because of the economic impacts of COVID-19 will be eligible for unemployment benefits, up to the regular 13-week period, if necessary",

Another $10 million would be spent on assisting 1,500 vulnerable families, identified by the Welfare Department and the Household Mitigation Unit.  She noted that the families would be given $600 monthly. Announced creation of the Barbados Adopt Our Families Programme. Persons who are laid off will immediately have the opportunity to get their unemployment benefits, guaranteeing them 60 per cent of their insurable earnings, up to a limit of 26 weeks.  The National Insurance Board has agreed to relax the requirement to visit the employment exchange at Warrens. The National Insurance Board will give those on short weeks 60 per cent of their earnings for those days.  For example, if a person is put on a three-day week, then the Board will pay 60 per cent of the wages the person would have earned for the other two days. For those employers who are prepared to retain three quarters of their workforce, even if some on short week, Government will defer their obligation to pay the employer’s contributions for three months, in the first instance, with the preparation to extend it for another three months if the crisis continues beyond that period. There will be a six-month payment moratorium on all existing loans and mortgages for persons and businesses who are directly affected and impacted by COVID-19.  Persons must go to their bank and work out those programmes. The commercial banks have also agreed to temporary working capital financing options for corporates and small businesses which are directly impacted by COVID-19. Government will recapitalize the Small Hotel Investment Fund with $20 million to allow small hotels to borrow and blend with other commercial funds so they can refurbish their property during this down period.  The interest rate for loans will no longer be five per cent but reduced to 3 1/2 per cent. Government will take $1 million from the Arts and Sports Development Fund to finance a programme dedicated to assisting artists, dancers and musicians create developmental content for Barbadians. The creation of a Jobs, Investment and Business Survival Programme. Government will facilitate businesses to use this pause in activity to upscale and invest so that they can come back stronger. In addition, Government will facilitate and fast track a number of investments where the private sector has the capital and is ready to move on the projects.",

The decree lays down that taxpayers engaged in the specified activities will be exempt from the payment of ‘kata’ – the flat-rate tax of small taxpayer businesses – for the months of March, April, May and June 2020. From March 1, 2020, the state tax authority will not charge any penalties in relation to tax debts up to the month following the quarter in which the state of emergency is lifted and for the duration of payment by instalments.",
